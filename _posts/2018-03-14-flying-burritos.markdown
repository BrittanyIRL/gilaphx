It’s hot in Crescent Ballroom. Albert Hammond Jr. doesn’t play for another three hours, but the Strokes t-shirts pile in by the dozen, scoping out viewing room to witness their six-string savior in the flesh. Porches are three deep into their set. They’ve just wrapped up “Be Apart”. I rub my left ear, a little off of center stage and feeling the full brunt of the cranked overhead speakers. I feel a push behind me and instinctively duck left as a body rushes forward, three beers ahead of me and followed by a friend. I saw this guy earlier, asking about Naname Ozone like it was the first time he’d said it out loud. Now, here he was with double the buzz, long hair drenched over a sleeveless denim jacket like Bob from Twin Peaks fronting a West Hollywood rock band that self-describes as “sizzling”. He looks around at the befuddled crowd with a self-righteous grin.

“Why isn’t this _lit_ yet? This should be fucking _lit_.”

One upside of a snail-paced day job is you get first dibs on the entire Internet. If your favorite brand surprise announces a small batch of solid gold hat pins or non-ironic flat caps, you have one in the mail within the hour. When ticketmaster has put all your chump friends in the waiting room, you are already halfway down the sidewalk to get victory coffee after snagging front row spots. You get to send your friends all the links. They never send you links - if they did, what would they even send? Yesterday’s news? 2pm’s gifs? Nothing but old hat, that’s for sure, because you are the king of the dibs, and it’s a fantastic existence and anyone who wants to trade it for meaningful or engaging work is a chump.

About a month out from the inaugural Lost Lake Music Festival, I saw a notification pop up in my Spam, which I always check in case there is a good deal on penis enlargers or in case an ambassador from a sovereign middle eastern nation needs me to wire them money. It was from a Lost Lake organizer at Superfly (the festival conglomerate that owns Bonnaroo and has all of your confiscated weed somewhere in a giant depository saving it all for the end times), testing the water for anyone willing to participate in a focus group to talk about the event. I scanned through the lines… no mention of date or time whatsoever. Would I have to miss any afternoon bands I paid to see? Or what about the locals with the unenviable spots at the very beginning of each day? Oh… wait… fifty dollars? And _free festival swag_? I clicked as hard and fast as my trackpad would let me.

The focus group was held on day 3 at the Clarendon Hotel a couple blocks away from the festival grounds at Steele Indian School Park. In typical focus group style, they huddled us together in the one room in the place devoid of personality. My group was all dudes, varied in shape and size of beard and hard part fades for appropriate representation. Once smalltalk died down, they got right to it, asking a simple question.

_Why are you here?_

Profound, really. I mean, I get that these are the people at Superfly or whoever Superfly hired to make sure that Lost Lake happens again and makes even _more_ money next year, so really, they should be able to get down a solid one-page answer to this soul-crushingly existential question.

Surprisingly, answers varied between three responses only:

1. Least popular response - I like the bands.
2. Slightly more popular response - I like the Killers and I drove here from Tucson just for the Killers so God help me if I don’t get to see the Killers.
3. Most popular response - I like my friends and my friends told me to go.

Upon further pressing, the small band of lemmings confided in each other, trading “I’m not high yet” smirks and name dropping meme rappers out of context mid-sentence to elicit group giggles. The cash would no doubt go towards a couple eleven dollar 24 oz Coors Lights (just kill me now) and maybe, if it wasn’t included in the free swag, a matching Lost Lake tank top and bandana to wear at the upcoming Gold Rush Festival at Rawhide. “Did you hear Ugly God will be there?” “Bro… [giggles] right?!”

Consider, if you will, the Phoenix music festival landscape. Gold Rush is only one of three annual festivals I can think off of the top of my head that devastates Rawhide every year in a giant dust bowl of creatine and blow. Pot of Gold was this month, and God bless Sturgill Simpson for bailing on that. Phoenix Lights was moved there last year, after city officials took pity on Margaret T. Hance Park after the free Chainsmokers show for NCAA March Madness (there were other acts, yes, but just know that someone let this travesty happen in broad daylight), but this year, will be moving on to devastate The Park at Wild Horse Pass instead.

When I was growing up, I went to exactly two music festivals. I went to EdgeFest in 2007 at Schnepf Farms in Queen Creek. Obadiah Parker played his “Hey Ya” cover barefoot in 90 degrees on the local stage, which was literally smaller than the mobile bar that only served Bud Light. After that, I stood behind the DuPree sisters of Eisley (who I was deeply in love with at time for their Series of Unfortunate Twee-vents aesthetic and their subtle appreciation for Star Wars) as we all watched Jimmy Eat World. The next year, I went to the Circle K Tempe Music Festival (no, there were no deals on Big Gulps) at Tempe Town Lake to see The Fray (with co-headliners O.A.R. And the Gin Blossoms) with a friend of mine, who showed me a radical new song on his iPod on the drive there - “Feel Good Inc.” by the Gorillaz. I didn’t have the heart to tell him it came out more than three years prior.

This is the toxic, Martian atmosphere that festival organizers enter into here in Phoenix. They put on their space suits and go out into the heat and the dry and pretend they can make breathing look good under all those layers. But at the end of the day, just like Matt Damon taught us, there’s little they can do to survive unless they learn to fertilize with their own shit. Or something along those lines.

Phoenix tends to treat every new music festival like its first and truest love, the Vans Warped Tour, where we are content with the constant brand pandering, indiscernible rotating white guy foursomes, and Mall of America sized merch tents in case your mom never let you go inside Hot Topic (fun fact: your mom will let you go to Lunchbox, which is the same store but without the faux-goth motif, for pop-culture savvy conservatives or people over 26 like me who still want to buy a Crash Bandicoot t-shirt without getting side eye and maybe I should find something else I don’t know what but I should so that I can get the 50% off deal just pick something so we can get the hell out of here already how do they know about Frisky Dingo am I old I think I’m old and also I’m out of touch and I don’t understand humor anymore hey wait they have a sale vinyl section with all old Disney soundtracks this is great holy hell this is still expensive).

VIVA PHX was the first time a Phoenix festival felt different to me. Maybe the trick is as simple as this: instead of getting national organizers or a band from Florida to come cash in on spring training or curate a brutally expensive paid art commune experience, why not do it local? Why not forego the big dumb infrastructure and use existing venues? Why worry about sound bleed when a nice walk down the street (or if you got stuck at Last Exit, a nice jog with a can of mace) got you to the next band in just as much time?

The last year VIVA PHX happened, you got to see Summer Cannibals and X play under blood red light at the downtown Masonic Lodge, because what says rock n roll better than 30 years of feminist punk fury and 90 years of cigarette smoke smoldering in the carpet? I couldn’t carry my beer to the LVL UP and HEALTH sets at the alley stage outside Valley Bar. By the time I got to American Football later on in the evening, I didn’t need another. The built in terms and conditions were what made VIVA what it was.

This year, Stateside called it on VIVA for a variety of reasons, and instead offered a low cost consolation prize: the Flying Burrito Festival, where twelve bucks got you 25 bands, four stages, an armada of food trucks, and maybe the most seating I’ve ever seen at a music festival, full stop. Think about how many people would pay twelve bucks just to sit their ass down.

Ten years on from The Fray, a move to and from Seattle, and approximately 500 shows and festivals later, I talked about Flying Burrito with a lot of people before I bought my tickets. “Hey are you going to Flying Burrito?” “Uh… yeah. It’s twelve bucks?” “Yeah.” “Yeah, that’s pretty sweet.” “Yeah. Who do you want to see?” “Oh, I don’t know. Anyone good playing?” “Porches... Haunted Summer... Moaning.” “Who?” “The Strokes guy.” “Oh, no way!” “Yeah.” “And it’s still twelve bucks?” “Yeah.” “Yeah, that’s pretty sweet.”

I bought my tickets on Wednesday night at Crescent’s monthly VMP giveaway, where I watched other people walk up and collect their shiny new 45 RPM remastered copies of Beach House’s _Devotion_ while listening to the album remixed live (i.e. played at the wrong speed with reverb and delay).

On Saturday, I snake locked my bike to a tree outside the Y’s back entrance on 2nd Ave. It took me a while to realize the stage where Moaning played was around the corner behind the porta-potties where it looked like there would just be more porta-potties. Someone told me the Nopales Stage had sound issues, but Crescent sounded normal. La Luz went long and sounded great. No Age went short and sounded fine. Porches started late and crossed out a bunch of songs on their setlist and I got sad for a minute because everything is fleeting and sometimes you just have to know when to call it.

I bought a chicken burrito from Chico Malo for $3 and it was really good so I bought the vegan burrito for $2 and it wasn’t as good. Jobot wasn’t selling coffee but they had a different chicken burrito that also looked good but it was $7. The food truck selling coffee ran out of alt milk while blasting Alt AZ 93.3. The belgian waffle truck was a weird outlier.

Later in the night, with my ears ringing from Moaning’s 25 minutes of scorch, I watched Vox Urbana with friends and contentedly swayed to the cumbia as the wind tickled the palms above. Crescent was too packed to get back for Albert, but I didn’t care. I had spent less than twenty bucks on food and drinks in a full afternoon of music and seen at least three acts to cross off my all time list all for the price of one of those fancy recliner movies. The last of my buzz was fading and the night felt right and for a moment I was fine with the fact that VIVA was gone because life is just a collection of experiences and most expectation beyond that is setting yourself up for failure.

But then it all ended. I saw a friend of a friend walking towards us, away from the stage, looking lost, like it was time to go but where to was neither here nor there. She waved politely, but didn’t stop, making her way through the “No Re Entry” gates and texting a friend with urgency, but not enough to just call. Where else would she go? What else is there in this moment? What else could you possibly want? Is it time to go home? Is it time to move on? Yes… yes, I suppose it is. I turned and walked out the gates. I un-snake locked my bike and I rode through the dark.

The guy brushes his hair back, looking around for confidantes. _Who else thinks it should be fucking lit?_ He looks to me, meeting my gaze for a moment, grinning like a lemming at a focus group, waiting for me to oblige. But I don’t. And soon, he turns and looks elsewhere. My meager offering isn’t worth much in the end - just another drop in an ocean of festival-goers, where some just prefer Corona to Coors.

Aaron Maine looks to sleeveless Bob, at first perturbed, but then the feeling passes. He looks around the room at the rest of the contented faces, bellies full of burritos, yawning and glancing to the bar for Red Bull to ensure they make it all the way to Albert’s set. They bob and sway as Greta rips it on the bass. They sing along politely between sips of cash only Oskar Blues. Aaron smiles. “You know”, he says in ubiquitous monotone, “I thought this was gonna be a shit show, but it’s not”.

 _Why are you here?_
