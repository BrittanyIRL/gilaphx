  <h1>Gila's Future</h1>
  <p><span class="gila_bold">We have a lot of ideas for Gila. </span> In fact, we probably have way too many to be at all productive. Our ultimate goal is to put on Gila-sponsored events quarterly at our favorite local venues. These events will have a dirt cheap entry fee, and even better, 100% of ticket sales (not profits, mind you - ticket sales) will go to benefit a rotation collection of arts organizations here in Phoenix. How rad is that?</p>
  <p>In order to do this, we need money to pay the venues and compensate the participating artists up front. We refuse to ask artists for charity. We'd much rather pay them at their deserved competitive rates. Once these costs are covered, that means that we can sell tickets at whatever rate we want to get venues packed out. Packed out venues mean better shows and more money for the arts. Everybody wins.</p>
  <p>First and foremost, our goal is to begin selling goods under the Gila brand, so that we can get some money rolling in for the events (we will also accept donations, as we are a fully certified 501 (c)(3), but we really don't like asking for them - we'd rather give you something with a Gila Monster on it). Gerrit and Brittany are working on their horchata recipe and candle scents now, but they could probably use some help. Thus, if you have any great ideas about how you can contribute to Gila through small gifts or goods, prints, sweets, clothing, or accessories, please <a href="http://localhost:4000/about#contact"> contact us</a>.</p>
  <p>Gila is not for profit or glory. We like our day jobs, and we don't want or need more money. All funds generated by the sale of Gila goods goes into our event funding pool or back into production. We ask the same dedication from any future Gila partners. Without the Phoenix arts scene, we would have nothing to do on nights and weekends other than sit at home and watch crappy TV. We want to make sure this doesn't happen. We'd love to extend this community further, mostly because we have no idea what we are doing.</p>
